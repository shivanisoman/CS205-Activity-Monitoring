# CS205-Activity-Monitoring
Activity Monitoring is the process of predicting a person’s activity based on certain gathered information. In most cases, activity monitoring for activities like walking, jogging, sitting, standing, etc. is done with the help of a smartwatch or fitness band. Various examples in the market include Fitbit, Misfit, Apple Watch, etc. These devices exploit the data obtained from various sensors like accelerometer, gyroscope or magnetometer in order to determine the activity a person is performing. In the majority of applications, this information is used for tracking fitness, calories and number of steps walked but can also be used in other domains like healthcare. This information could be used in certain situations where a doctor would like to monitor a patient’s activity remotely. It could also be useful to track the activities of older patients or even in certain applications involving fall detection.
 

In this project, we use sensor information obtained via a smartwatch and build a model that successfully determines the type of user activity. We used information from multiple sensors like accelerometer and gyroscope and also used various different classifiers and classification techniques to determine the best one. We have considered four different activities as follows - Laying Down, Sitting, Standing and Walking.
